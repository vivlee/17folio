                    <p>Often, university students started by applying to the biggest industry names first.</p><br/>
                    <blockquote><p><b>Insight 2:</b> And when we asked recruiters what their biggest reason for applicant rejection was, 83.3% of respondents rated ‘poor match between candidate and job position’ as their biggest reason for rejection!</p></blockquote><br/>

            <p>In order to test this risk of how companies can ensure their image is being accurately represented by student ambassadors, Jessica and I worked together to complete service enactments with 2 companies and 1 student.</p><br/>
            <p>In fact, due to the number of interest expressed by our participants, we were able to indirectly involve multiple individuals in a realistic system that would take place in a brand-ambassador relationship.</p><br/>
            <p class="callout">First, I interviewed 2 San Diego-based startups that I recruited using my own personal and professional connections.</p><br/>
            <p>In order to simulate what it would be like to pick out brand ambassadors from a directory, I gave these startups a quick on-boarding slide deck to explain to them the company model and a series of student profile cards for our companies to choose from, both of which I created myself on Google Slides.</p><br/>
            <p class="callout">Then, I interviewed a random student that my teammate recruited from UCSD’s Facebook group.</p><br/>
            <p>After posting on our university’s Free and For Sale group advertising a one-time brand ambassador stint, my team member received a response from Karen, a 3rd year Communications major with 2400+ Facebook friends, a member of the Tri Delta sorority, and a residential assistant for the dorms.</p><br/>
            <p>After we both met with her, we gave her a brief on-boarding document with company details, as well as a template for how she should post to social media —which I was able to create using real details we received from the social app startup we interviewed earlier.</b></p>

My weaknesses lie in practicing design with a critical eye, and from this assignment, I’ve become sharper and more steadfast in creating refined product experiences for a user’s primary needs.</p><br/>
            <p>Thinking back, while it was important to make the distinction between popular plays and personal plays, there's also the factor of how old a song is, which can create problems in determining the number of plays for trending tracks. In the future, I would love to explore more time-sensitive filters and conditions for how to appropriately flag tracks that are 'currently in'.</p><br/>
