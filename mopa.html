                            <p>In order to gain a better idea of the specific needs of their visitors, we conducted research on general museum visitors from all over the state by sending out online surveys and conducting ethnographic interviews with people that we knew. In order to narrow down our target demographic, we decided to focus more strongly on figuring out ways to engage local family populations. </p><br/>

                            <blockquote><p><b>We asked ourselves:</b> What were the goals visitors wanted to achieve when they enter an exhibit? In what ways did people expect to engage with museum galleries?</p></blockquote><br/>

                            <p>We started by conducting a physical heuristic evaluation of the museum and contextual inquiries with museum visitors to answer these questions.</p><br/>
                            <p>Namely, we were interested in (1) how they interacted with exhibits they found interesting, (2) how they navigated to the next display, and (3) who they often engaged with while viewing them.</p>

                            <p><b>Insight 1:</b> Although families often came as an entire group, these visitors were usually split into smaller pairs or left to wander on their own.</p>
                            <p><b>Insight 2:</b> Even though visitors were typically not allowed to touch exhibits, they were more intent on creating a memorable experience out of their visit rather than simply take home a souvenir.</p>
                            <p><b>Insight 3:</b> In fact, visitors were more likely to visit again if the exhibits, or at least their experiences, held personal relevance to them.</p>
                        </blockquote><br/>

                        <p>Most importantly, we realized that although visitors harnessed available digital tools to interact with the artwork, they also used their <b>personal devices</b> to create their own unique digital experiences.</p><br/>

                    <p>After synthesizing our research into core insights, it was time to start brainstorming solutions. To begin, we asked ourselves four initial questions:</p>
                    <p>(1) Whether visitors needed to know about MOPA before coming to museum.</p>
                    <p>(2) Whether our solution would involve the whole family.</p>
                    <p>(3) If people would be able to take away an experience or souvenir from our solution.</p>
                    <p>(4) Whether our solution was sustainable and low-budget.</p><br/>

                    <p class="callout">We needed to find a way that would not only bring new interest to the museum, but would also retain repeat visitors willing to visit the museum over upcoming years.</p><br/>

                    <p>Therefore, in order to ensure that our solution was not only effective, but also sustainable in the long run, we needed to create a prototype that would be cheap and quick to implement.</p>
