                        <blockquote><p><b>We asked ourselves:</b> In what scenarios did users typically create, add to, and manage their playlists? What goals did they want to accomplish, and what frustrations were commonplace?</p></blockquote><br/>

                <p>After our contextual inquiry, my team and I got back together to discuss our findings.</p><br/>
                <blockquote>
                    <p><b>Insight 1:</b> While most playlists were created for personal use, there were various instances where playlists were shared among a number of individuals, such as during road trips, parties, and hangouts.</p>
                    <p><b>Insight 2:</b> When discovering new music genres or categories for the first time, users often began with influential artists that were popular or 'trending' for that genre.</p>
                    <p><b>Insight 3:</b> When revising or updating their playlists, interview participants tended to remove songs that they skipped often first.</p>
                    </blockquote><br/>

                    <p>As a result, we decided to center our redesign around two main use cases: <b>(1) creating playlists with the intention to discover new genres,</b> and <b>(2) updating existing playlists with a person's changing taste in music.</b></p><br/>

                    <p>On SoundCloud, however, these entry points for music discovery were hidden under the unintuitive 'Search' navigation.</p><br/>

                    <blockquote><p>We also found from our contextual inquiry that users were reluctant to go back and revise their playlists due to the amount of decision-making that had to be made on whether to delete a song or not.</p></blockquote><br/>

                    <p>Those that did update their playlists on a regular basis, in fact, took into account how often they listened to each track. However, SoundCloud's platform allowed almost little to no control over a user's personal playlists.</p><br/>

                    <p>Therefore, our key design decisions for creating a new playlist app involved: <b>(1) including an accessible navigation for new, trending music,</b> and <b>(2) creating a intuitive, more seamless way to decide whether to keep a song in a playlist.</b></p>

                    <p>As the interaction design lead of my team, I created the workflows for <b>(1) adding a new track to an existing playlist</b> and <b>(2) revising an existing playlist in the library.</b></p><br/>

                    <p>From our contextual interviews using SoundCloud, we found that music discovery must be made explicit through either a trending feed separate from the home feed or through an accessible search function.</p><br/>

                    <blockquote><p>Users claimed that when creating a playlist, they were more interested in finding recommendations that were considered 'trendy' and popular to the public when taking new forays into music, rather than rely purely on suggested tracks from artists they have already heard of.</p></blockquote><br/>

                    <p>As a result, I prioritized being able to easily discover (and then, add) new tracks to a user's playlists.</p><br/>

                    <p>From our contextual interviews using Spotify, we also saw that users made gratuitous use of the filters and sorting options on its application.</p><br/>

                    <blockquote><p>When asked to walk through how they revised their existing playlists, they replied that they often removed songs they didn't listen to often or tended to skip.</p></blockquote><br/>

                    <p>Therefore, I specifically designed the ability to filter by the number of plays, in order to allow users to quickly revise and update playlists for songs they are no longer interested in.</p><br/>

                <p>Ultimately, I gained a lot of insight from trying to design an app based on some of the most popular music platforms, specifically in how we can turn visible breakdowns into concrete design opportunities for a better user experience. My weaknesses lie in practicing design with a critical eye, and from this assignment, I’ve become sharper and more steadfast in creating refined product experiences for a user’s primary needs.</p><br/>
                <p>Thinking back, while it was important to make the distinction between popular plays and personal plays, there's also the factor of how old a song is, which can create problems in determining the number of plays for trending tracks. In the future, I would love to explore more time-sensitive filters and conditions for how to appropriately flag tracks that are 'currently in'.</p><br/>
