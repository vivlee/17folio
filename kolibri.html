                            <p><b>Insight 3:</b> Rather than assign struggling students in static and unchanging groups with other peers at a similar learning level, teachers often separated the classroom into different stations where students rotated every thirty minutes and thus, never stayed in the same instructional group for too long.</p>

                    <blockquote>
                        <p><b>Feature 1:</b> An integrated lesson plan with actionable recommendations, as we found that although the original dashboard presented a large amount of information to use in planning classroom instruction, there was little guidance or direction on how this data could be interpreted</p>
                        <p><b>Feature 2:</b> Progress statistics for weekly class development, in order track student improvement on an ongoing basis.</p>
                        <p><b>Feature 3:</b> A separate module for peer-to-peer group planning, because many of our interview participants organized student engagement in dynamic groups rather than single out individual intervention.</p>
                    </blockquote><br/>

                    <p>With data gathered from our user interviews, we prioritized adding these features above anything else.</p><br/>

                    <p>As my first UX design internship, I made a lot of progress in the shaky transition from academic assignments to industry-appropriate standards. It was difficult designing for instructors when I had little teaching experience myself, but being on the other side of the school system lended me empathetic views that allowed me to account for the entire classroom as a context. It inspired me to dig deep into my research, and I was able to explore forays into remote usability testing, contextual interviews, and ethnographic fieldwork.</p><br/>
                    <p>My biggest contributions were my methods for user research. With the user discussion guide I developed, the organization could now obtain richer, qualitative feedback that would otherwise be lost in a regular questionnaire or survey. Even after my exit from the internship, the protocol that I detailed myself has still been used to gather further research by the remaining full-timers on the team.</p><br/>
