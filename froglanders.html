                            <p>As part of a quarter-long project for my practicum in pro web design, I worked in a team of 4 to find a client in need of a new website, meeting with him every 2 weeks to account for constant communication and feedback. As a studio-based class, I actively participated in presentations and design critique sessions with my peers. </p><br/>

                            <p>As a result, my team of 4 delivered a fully functional, HTML/CSS prototype of our website design For Froglanders Café, a frozen yogurt shop in La Jolla.</p><br/>

                        <blockquote><p><b>Client Survey:</b> To do this, I first probed the client with questions my teammates and I prepared before the meeting. Asking questions, such as his inspiration for his cafe and what makes it different from other frozen yogurt shops, helped us understand the vision he has for his business. </p>
                        <p><b>Participatory Design:</b> After I collected his responses, I invited him to draw out how he thought the content should be arranged on his website. We also printed out pages of his original site in the early 2000s, prompting him to mark typical user behavior on the site, identify key opportunities for change, and any personal causes for concern.</p></blockquote><br/>
                        <p>From there, we were able to gain a better idea of the goals and objectives that our client had in mind. </p><br/>

                <p>Several competitors we looked at included <span class="sliding-u-l-r"><a href=“http://hammondsgourmet.com”>Hammond’s</a></span>, <span class="sliding-u-l-r"><a href=“http://yogurt-land.com">Yogurtland</a></span>, <span class="sliding-u-l-r"><a href=“http://pinkberry.com”>Pinkberry</span></a>, and <span class="sliding-u-l-r"><a href=“http://binghaus.com”>Bing Haus</span></a>. Common trends we found include:</p><br/>

               <blockquote>
                <p><b>Strong Imagery:</b> Rather than rely on text to convey meaningful values of people eating food, 3 out of 4 competitors use heavy imagery to illustrate desserts as an experience to be had, rather than a product to be bought. </p>
                <p><b>Ubiquitous Branding:</b> Furthermore, strong consistency between typography and color make users associate a strong, welcoming brand for these competitors. </p>
                </blockquote><br/>
                <p>From there, we were able to focus on what we could consider taking inspiration from in each website.</p><br/>

            <blockquote>
            <p><b>Communication of Products ⇿ Easy-to-Read Menu:</b> Because the client’s shop rotates their frozen yogurt flavors daily, in addition to offering more than 75+ toppings, the extensive menu must be easy-to-read. From our user testing, we found that this essentially meant easy-to-skim, as users often have limited time to browse for what they want. </p><br/>
            <p><b>Online Branding ⇿ Shop Atmosphere:</b> In order to properly convey the frozen yogurt shop’s cafe-like atmosphere, online branding presence is important and must express this image throughout the site. When these two are connected, the audience should be able to effectively gauge Froglanders’ in-store atmosphere just from browsing the site. </p><br/>
            <p><b>History & Core Values ⇿ Rich Imagery:</b> Like we saw from our earlier competitive analysis, images can often express more than words. Because most of the staff is made up of the client and his parents, we want to leverage this business image as historic, personable, and full of character —with the use of rich, vibrant images. </p><br/>
            <p><b>Increase in New Customers ⇿ Easy Navigation:</b> With goals for a 20% increase in walk-in traffic, the website must then be intuitive and straightforward enough for new users to easily navigate. </p>
            </blockquote><br/>
            <p>While these two sets of goals initially appeared to be unrelated, closer examination reveals that in fact, there are many overlaps between what the client needed and what the website audience needed. </p><br/>

            <p>For our final design, we revisited our main objectives and prioritized a site that was mobile-friendly, image-heavy, and informative.</p><br/>
            <blockquote><p><b>However, from user testing, we found that more information is not necessarily better:</b> As a result, for our final design, I cut back on words and instead chose images that would convey Froglanders’ values for character, service and natural delight. </p></blockquote><br/>
            <p>Although we tried showing all flavors at the top —separate from the other flavors— we made the final decision to exclude flavors that weren’t available that day. As for nutritional information, we simplified the previous list of ingredients into categories such as sugar-free, lactose-free, and vegan, indicated by labels below a given flavor.</p><br/>
            <blockquote><p><b>Furthermore, users only seek the most immediately relevant information in their goals</b> For our final design, I included a (dismissible) banner that would follow users as they scroll, informing them of that day’s hours from the very beginning. </p></blockquote><br/>
            <p>Although I had to change the verbiage around, I ultimately decided to not only display whether the cafe was open at the time of viewing —but also when it would be open until on that day. </p><br/>
            <blockquote><p><b>Finally, in order to craft a smooth narrative in conjunction with Froglander Cafe’s brand:</b> The page opens with an introductory header image, followed by an informative, personal blurb about its history.</p></blockquote><br/>
            <p>Below that, frozen yogurt flavors and toppings can be read, as well as a process describing the natural ingredients used in its desserts. At the very bottom, the hours and address can be found. </p><br/>

                <h3>Final Thoughts</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Designing for a Client</li>
                </ul>

        <div class="col-md-7">
            <p>I’m happy to say that I was able to finish off my last design class at UCSD with a bang. I had an incredible team working with my team and my client to design a responsive site that would meet the needs for both families in San Diego, as well as local college students. Despite my previous experience working with a client at the <span class="sliding-u-l-r"><a href="https://mopasd.org">Museum of Photographic Arts</a></span>, I learned a lot about balancing my client’s needs with the audience’s needs —especially in my role as a UX designer and user advocate. </p><br/>
            <p>From the design point of view, the target audience's objectives in using the finished program are far more important than the client's objectives, and the difference must be kept straight. However, comparing the two can allow us to draw parallels that might not otherwise be seen. </p><br/>
            <p>One of the hardest decisions we made as a team included reworking our initial multi-page design into a one-page website, due to our findings from later testing. Sometimes, our first assumptions are wrong —and it’s critical that despite conducting user interviews and developing personas to define these assumptions, we ultimately need to test the credibility of our hypotheses by putting them in front of real people.</p><br/>
